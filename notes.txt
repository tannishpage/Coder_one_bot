We can prioritize two actions.

1. We can aim to eliminate the other player by killing them
2. We can aim to gain maximum points by being non-lethal
3. We can half-half points and elimiation

For 1:
   For this one, we need to track the location of two things, one the bombs and two the player.
   Since our goal is to eliminate the player, we want to ensure we have as many bombs as possible
   While we place bombs around or in range of the opponent. This way we ensure we take out the player
   as soon as possible.
   
For 2:
   We need to track the location of the bombs and the player and every other point giving object
   we want to make sure that we steal points from the opponent as well as get our own points.
   Since we aren't aiming to eliminate the opponent we don't have to place bombs such that the opponent is in range.
   
For 3:
   Prioritize placing bomb in range of opponent when it is near, otherwise aim to get points
